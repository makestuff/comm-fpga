------------------ FPGALINK'S INTERFACE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD -------------------

This is an abstraction layer, with an internal-facing interface and an external-
facing interface. There are several implementations, each of which share the
same internal interface but differ in their external interface.

The internal interface provides an address, or channel ID, which ranges from
0-127, and a pair of 8-bit FIFO interfaces, one for reading and another for
writing. Each has an active-high "valid" signal driven by the sender, and an
active-high "ready" signal driven by the receiver. On a rising edge of the
clock, if both valid and ready are high, the eight data bits are transferred
from the sender to the receiver.

The external interface differs depending on how the microcontroller implementing
the CommFPGA protocol is wired to the FPGA. Currently there are three separate
implementations:

  FX2LP slave-FIFO interface (15 I/Os, ~45MB/s)
  EPP interface (12 I/Os, ~330KB/s)
  Synchronous serial interface (3 I/Os, ~650KB/s)
